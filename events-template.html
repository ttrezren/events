    <span> <span id="thumbnail"><img width="180px" height="120px"></span> <span id="description">German choreographer and director Pina Bausch engaged the personal and social experiences of body, space, time and energy. For Bausch, movement was not only a language; it was a palette of behavior that explored the contradictions of the personal body in relation to its social embodiments. Notably, the conversation between dreamer and the dream runs throughout Bausch’s non-linear approaches to narrative. At the same time, there are concrete elements in which each dancer is a distinct character, whose age, gender and other identity markers are not accidental. These characters, and their movements, leave behind searing visual images that linger long after their ephemeral gestures have faded from view. Choreographer Nina Haft will offer a window into the choreographic process of Pina Bausch and with the help of Orit Atzmon, we will link it to psychoanalytic ideas of creativity and the dream.</p></span></span> </div>
